,,,,,,Poor pay and benefits,19 Dec 2022,Senior Software Engineer,"London, England",The people at PA are great with a lot of talent and experience.,"- Although the people you work with are great there is high turnover due to no career progression and poor pay and benefits.

- The choices you get for hardware setup are poor and are the same options that a journalist or data entry operator would get. For example, if you need a new keyboard you get a £5 rubbish one from Dell. You don’t get choice for a decent monitor let alone a 4K or curved one. You get bottom of the range monitor. No decent chairs or desks. Basically the lowest of the low options.

- The projects are dull and it’s mostly maintenance of ancient systems (Perl) that no one knows anything about.

- Executive management appear to be mostly IT illiterate as they are from wide ranging backgrounds and don’t understand or care about things like tech debt",Current Employee,more than 3 years,0,,0

,,,,,,About what you'd expect,7 Oct 2022,Page Producer,"Howden, England","If you're considering joining the page production department at Howden, it's important to take on board where PA Media fits in as part of this arm of the media industry and how this is reflected in the job, pay and benefits etc. 

Basically, PA is subcontracted by several major newspaper and magazine publishers to produce and sub-edit content (mainly TV listings). Once upon a time this kind of work would have been done in-house at each magazine, likely by trained journalists or editors, but as the traditional print industry contracts, it's cheaper for the publishing companies to outsource this responsibility to a central provider.

So in terms of pros: you will certainly be working on national print magazines and be able to legitimately claim to work in the media. Up until a restructuring at the end of 2020, the hours were also pretty agreeable, with half-day finishes and 4-day weeks up for grabs on some titles.","At the end of the day, this arm of the business is built on the objective of saving clients' money, so expect low pay, minimum training, frequent staff cuts and not much room for progression, outside of moving up a rank or so in the page production department itself. 

If you're at all ambitious, you'll find it's not particularly great as a stepping stone into 'proper' journalism due to lack of training, antipathy to subbing factories within the industry and, shockingly, refusal to recognise the NUJ.",Former Employee,more than 8 years,0,0,1
